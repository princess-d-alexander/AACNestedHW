Overview:

Project Description:

In this mini-project, I implemented a simple Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system using an AssociativeArray. The goal was to map images to categories and words, allowing users to select an image and receive corresponding text. The system is designed with accessibility in mind, focusing on supporting individuals with communication difficulties. By extending the AssociativeArray class, I developed a solution that maps image locations to words and categories. This project also involved handling testing and ensuring that the system functions properly within a larger project framework.
